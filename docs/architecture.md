# Architecture

Agent Packs should feel like Homebrew for agent capabilities while keeping the CLI and registry separable.

## Production Stack

- CLI: Go module under `cli/`.
- Registry packs: static JSON manifests under `registry/packs/`.
- Registry skills: Agent Skill source references under `registry/skills/<id>/SKILL.md`.
- Registry plugins: Claude Code plugin source references under `registry/plugins/<id>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
- Schema: `registry/schemas/agent-pack.schema.json`.
- Receipts: `<target>/receipts/<pack-id>.json`.
- Lockfiles: `<target>/packs/<pack-id>/agent-pack.lock`, including source revision fields when locally resolvable.

## CLI Commands

Implemented commands:

- `agent-packs search [query]`
- `agent-packs show <pack>`
- `agent-packs install <pack|registry/pack>`
- `agent-packs list`
- `agent-packs uninstall <pack>`
- `agent-packs doctor`
- `agent-packs doctor targets`
- `agent-packs validate <file-or-directory>`
- `agent-packs registry add <name> <source>`
- `agent-packs registry list`
- `agent-packs registry remove <name>`
- `agent-packs update --all`
- `agent-packs outdated`
- `agent-packs cache`
- `agent-packs scan [path]`
- `agent-packs import <skills-dir>`
- `agent-packs lint <pack>`
- `agent-packs verify <pack>`
- `agent-packs resolve <pack>`

## Install Experience

Target install experience:

```sh
brew install agent-packs
agent-packs install frontend-engineer
```

Bootstrap fallback:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://agentpacks.dev/install.sh | sh
```

## Security Posture

Plugin install commands are not executed unless the user passes `--execute-plugins`. Plugin capabilities with install commands should set `requiresExecution: true` and should include trust metadata such as `trust: "official"` or `trust: "community"`.

The target matrix maps supported tools to global and project skill directories. Registry skills and plugins are referenced from their upstream source and are not copied into the selected agent target. Pack-level `skills` and `plugins` can be registry ID strings or object refs with remote `source` URLs, so a pack can depend on a remote skill/plugin without vendoring it into this registry. The Agent Pack spec keeps `source` as the installer-resolved location or command; optional `upstreamSource` is only for separate provenance or attribution metadata. Inline skill capabilities can still opt into copy/fetch behavior, and inline plugin commands can still opt into native execution with `--execute-plugins`. Integrity metadata can be represented with `integrity.checksum` and `integrity.signature`; lockfiles record a digest and resolved revision metadata for every capability when available.

## Why Go

Go is the safest default for a brew-like developer tool:

- Single binary distribution.
- Fast startup.
- Good filesystem and archive support.
- Easy release automation with GitHub Actions.
- Clean cross-compilation.
- Familiar enough for infrastructure-oriented contributors.
